**Lifts**
Base point value of 100 for 1 rep of 1rm. (Initial time doing this lift means the heaviest lift is the 1rm, the rest will be computed based on that.)
Other lower lifts get point value based on percentage, up to 10 reps.  After 10 reps, they get 50% of that point value per rep for another 10 reps, etc.
Maybe 150 points for a new 1rm?
Possibly some kind of level up value for breaking into a different level based on strstd standards?

**Cardio**
I have no idea how to handle this fairly.  New people shouldn't be penalized for running only a mile, but a marathon should obviously be worth more.  Maybe get some cardio people's input on how to handle this fairly.

**HIIT**
I feel like this needs it's own category.  Going by distance and speed doesn't make sense for hill sprints and such.  Under this category: Prowler push, hill sprint, bike HIIT.

Again, 100 point baseline for time/distance.  Break either of these to get the 50pt 1rm+ type calculation for the session.

**Bodyweight Work**
This would include yoga and gymnastics.

Yoga works through a progression, so maybe we could handle this like a complex?  A specific hold wouldn't be timed, but you could look at how many times you did a set of positions in a yoga workout.  We could use a yoga expert for hold names - some people use the English name and some the ... Sandskrit? ... name.  100pts for a complex, bonus for spending longer on it?  Maybe something could be figured out for progression of hold difficulty (crow stand vs hand stand).

Gymnastics is a little more straightforward - holds for time are easier to figure out.  100pts for doing a hold for the 1rm time, 50pt bonus for going up by ... say ... 30 seconds?
