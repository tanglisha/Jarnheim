Levels

Let's say that we start with a limit of level 10.
This would mean we need 10 pieces of avitar art for male and 10 for female.

0 Avitar is a scrawny guy/girl in a loincloth or similar, a little hunched over.
1 Avitar gains becomes tone.
2 Avitar gains leather armor and boots.
3 Avitar gains more muscle.
4 Avitar gains a helmet.
5 Avitar stands up straight.
6 Avitar gains a sword.
7 Avitar gains more muscle.
8 Avitar gains a shield.
9 Avitar gains hero stance (like He-Man).
10 Avitar gains a cape.

We could do something similar for guild levels, maybe with a Viking ship that ends up with fancy shields, a masthead, and sails.
