Levels

Let's say that we start with a limit of level 10.
This would mean we need 10 pieces of avitar art for male and 10 for female.

0 Avitar is a scrawny guy/girl in a loincloth or similar, a little hunched over.
1 Avatar gains becomes tone.
2 Avatar gains leather armor and boots.
3 Avatar gains more muscle.
4 Avatar gains a helmet.
5 Avatar stands up straight.
6 Avatar gains a sword.
7 Avatar gains more muscle.
8 Avatar gains a shield.
9 Avatar gains hero stance (like He-Man).
10 Avatar gains a cape.

We could do something similar for guild levels, maybe with a Viking ship that ends up with fancy shields, a masthead, and sails.

We could also have participation badges for people that aren't necessarily progressing very much.  Maybe a crow for someone that goes out and does a lot of different things, a bag of goald for someone that participates every few days even if they don't gain many points, etc.
